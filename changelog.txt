= 2.5.0 (August 16, 2021) =
* tl;dr - WordPress 5.8 support and fixes, more hidden blocks by default
* [Fix] Use updated `block_editor_settings_all` filter instead of deprecated `block_editor_settings`. Support for old filter will be removed in a future version

* [Fix] Re-hide `drop-cap` after change in WordPress settings array.

= 2.4.0 (January 7, 2021) =

* WordPress 5.6 support confirmed
* [New] Hide Jetpack Blocks: Markdown, Star Rating, Repeat Visitor, OpenTable, Revue, Eventbrite Tickets, GIF, Calendly, and WhatsApp Button. Adds `mrw_jetpack_hidden_blocks` filter, allowing developers to easily unhide these blocks while also making it easier to hide other Jetpack blocks!

* [Fix] Resolve notice from Block Editor Colors plugin when using a theme without a custom color palette.
* [Fix] Only add body classes that hide editor settings on the Block Editor screen
* [Dev] **Deprecated Filters (Sorry for doing this again, last time I foresee):** Replace "disabled" with "hidden" and "style variations" with "block styles" for improved clarity.
	* `mrw_disabled_blocks` ➡ `mrw_hidden_blocks`
	* `mrw_disabled_style_variations` ➡ `mrw_hidden_block_styles`
	* `mrw_disabled_block_editor_settings` ➡ `mrw_hidden_block_editor_settings`
